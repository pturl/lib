## Apple App Store Dominates Mobile Platform Revenue But Google Play Growing Fast  
### **Breakdown of Revenue and Downloads by Mobile Platform** 
When examining revenue share by mobile app platform, the Apple App Store has generated the vast majority at $1.2 billion, which represents 75.4% of Roblox's total $1.5 billion in lifetime player spending. The Google Play Store has seen fast growth but trails behind at $389.2 million, comprising 24.6% of revenue. In terms of downloads, Google Play holds a larger share than revenue with 287 million installs (75%). Meanwhile, the Apple App Store makes up the remaining 96 million downloads (25%). iPad users in particular have been big spenders, accounting for 39.4% of revenue or $623.8 million.
## Monthly and Annual Mobile Game Spending Varies Globally
### **Comparisons of Average Annual Mobile Gaming Expenditure**
Analyzing annual mobile gaming expenditures provides helpful context. According to the ESA and Statista, the average American gamer spent $216.64 on games in 2018. On a global scale, estimated average annual spending per mobile gamer that year was $55.16. However, spending habits vary significantly between countries based on factors like average household income. Wealthier nations tend to see annual expenditures approach $2,000 per gamer, while estimates in developing economies run closer to $450. It's also important to note some portions of the player bases in any country may opt to spend $0 on in-game purchases.
## Roblox Hits New Revenue Highs During Height of Global Pandemic Lockdowns
### **Roblox Revenue Growth Accelerates Amidst Worldwide Quarantines**
Roblox's runaway success in 2020 coincided with the peak of worldwide quarantines and stay-at-home orders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. With people sheltering in place and seeking interactive entertainment and social activities online, Roblox engagement and monetization skyrocketed. Monthly player spending reached new heights, with May 2020 setting an all-time single-month record of $102.9 million in revenue. Roblox's creative digital worlds offered a welcome escape for quarantined users looking to socialize virtually and unleash their imagination. As a result, 2020 revenue is on pace to greatly surpass prior years and cement Roblox's position as a top-grossing mobile game.
## Beyond Gaming: Investing Opportunities Emerging at the Intersection of Mobile Apps and Cryptocurrency
### **Potential Investment: Indonesian Nickel Miner Launching Own Cryptocurrency** 
As the digital economy evolves, new opportunities are emerging where technologies like mobile apps, cryptocurrencies and even commodity mining intersect. One such opportunity worth monitoring is an Indonesian nickel mining company called Luminos Graha. In addition to extracting the metal used in electric vehicle batteries and stainless steel production, Luminos Graha aims to launch its own cryptocurrency token called LUMI. The company hopes gaming and other apps will integrate LUMI as an in-game currency, generating transaction volume. If successful, Luminos Graha's unique business model could potentially become quite valuable. Its development is one of several emerging areas at the mobile-crypto crossroads worth following for savvy investors.
## Strong App Engagement and Creative Tools Boost Robux Purchases 
### **Factors Influencing Monthly Active User Spending within Roblox**
Monthly active user spending within the Roblox platform depends greatly on engagement levels and the tools available. Wealthier player demographics like those in North America, Europe and parts of Asia tend to average higher annual Robux purchases. However, monthly expenditure can range wildly from $0 to well over users' disposable incomes depending on individual usage habits. Outside developing regions, average annual spending may approach $2,000 according to some estimates. Roblox fosters continued interaction and purchases by cultivating a creative community. Its 3D game development toolbox lets ambitious builders flex their design muscles, while the resulting content keeps seasoned players entertained. When MAUs feel engaged and inspired in the Roblox universe, theyâ€™re more apt to purchase virtual goods.
## Conclusion
In summary, Roblox has experienced unprecedented global growth in 2020 driven by widespread lockdowns urging users of all ages online for virtual socialization and entertainment. Its mobile gaming platform in particular eclipsed impressive revenue milestones, generating over $1.5 billion in lifetime user spending just seven months after reaching $1 billion. Success has been broad-based with major contributions from high spending countries like the US and leading mobile channels like the Apple App Store. With enhanced creative tools sustaining user involvement and a continuously evolving digital world for players to explore, Roblox seems poised to continue expanding its reach worldwide for years to come.
