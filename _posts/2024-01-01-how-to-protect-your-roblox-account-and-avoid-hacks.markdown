### Beware of Free **Robux** Scams
Robux are an in-game currency used to purchase items and gear within Roblox. Many websites and games claim to give out free robux but are actually scams to steal account details. They are able to steal the user's **ROBLOSECURITY** token which contains login cookies and passwords. Two accounts were lost to such scams in the past due to accessing these sites. Never put any account or payment details into these obvious scams.

### Use Strong and Unique Passwords   
Easy to guess passwords like 1234567890 are very vulnerable to hacking. Using the same password across multiple sites leaves all accounts at risk if one is compromised. Strong, unique passwords for each account and service protects from mass password list hacks.
### Avoid Sharing Account Details 
Telling others your password, even jokingly, could lead to it being stolen. Friends may share it accidentally ormaliciously hack the account for themselves. Keep login credentials private and never share them online or through messages.  
### Beware of Phishing Attempts
Hackers may try contacting users pretending to be Roblox support. Their goal is to trick users into providing login details to steal the account. Only provide information to official Roblox sites and never through outside links or messages.
### Enable Two-Factor Authentication   
Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA apps like Google Authenticator is strongly recommended. Even if the password is cracked, hackers cannot access the account without the second code. This makes accounts significantly more secure against hacking attempts.
### Be Careful What You Click 
Never install files or put scripts into the browser developer tools without understanding them. This has been used before to compromise accounts and should always be avoided. Only interact with official game experiences and sites from the main Roblox domain.
### Report Compromised Accounts Immediately    
If an account is hacked, contact Roblox support right away for the best chance of recovery. The longer a hacker has access, the more damage can be done like scams or inappropriate content. Quick reporting helps limit how much the account can be misused.
### Consider All Recovery Avenues
With login email access, support may be able to assist in account take back depending on circumstances. If hacked for scams or other rule violations, termination is a possibility even if regained. The best approach is prevention to avoid needing recovery.
### Learn From Experience
Users who had accounts previously compromised can help others by sharing lessons learned. The tips in this article aim to help Roblox players protect themselves and their creations. With vigilance and safe practices, the risk of account takeovers can be greatly reduced.
