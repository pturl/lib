### My account was banned
I received an email saying my Roblox account was banned for **"hacking".** I didn't hack and was confused about why this happened. I was devastated to lose my account that I had spent so much time and **money building up** over the years.

### Attempting to appeal the ban  
I immediately filled out an appeal form on the Roblox support site, hoping a real person would review my case. However, the automated response said it could take 1-3 days to process. I anxiously waited to hear back. 
### Finally getting a response   
After three long days, I received an email saying my appeal was approved. To my surprise and relief, I had my account back. However, the experience taught me to be careful communicating with **support staff**.
### Tips for successfully appealing a ban
The post offered valuable tips, such as submitting an appeal quickly, expecting a 1-3 day wait, and not trusting the reliability of Roblox's **account moderation process**. It's important to remain respectful when appealing, as one wrong move could result in a permanent ban.
### The challenges of the account restoration process   
With only 400 people **reviewing account appeals**, the chances of getting unbanned are low. It's a frustrating process for those who were wrongly banned through no fault of their own. Patience is key while waiting for a resolution. 
### Coping with the loss of an important account
For those still banned, it's easy to feel disappointed and miss the account deeply. However, it's important to accept what cannot be changed and view it as an opportunity to move forward in a positive way.
### A banned account from years ago 
This user described being banned two years prior for an **"unauthorized charge"**, though their account security had been compromised. They reached out for help, hoping an admin could **review the old banning case** and restore access.
### The amount of money invested  
To emphasize why restoring the account was so important, details were shared about the significant time and **money spent building it up** over the years. Losing permanent access to that virtual profile and progress was understandably upsetting.
### Ongoing hope for resolution   
In closing, there remains hope that by continuing determined communication, wrongly banned accounts may eventually be reinstated. In the meantime, all former users can do is wait patiently and appeal for administrative review of unclear or unjust banning decisions.
