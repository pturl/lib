### Understanding the Phenomenon
Akinator is an online artificial intelligence game where players **think of a character, object or animal** and Akinator tries to deduce it through a series of yes or no questions similar to 20 Questions. It has accumulated **a huge database and continuously learns** from user interactions which is why it remains challenging to stump even after multiple rounds.

### A Foundation of Immense Data
Akinator's database is the core of its abilities, including **almost everything imaginable sorted by categories**. This **vast collection of knowledge** allows it to **strategically narrow down options** based on the pattern of user responses. Without this immense foundation of data, it would not be able to perform its mind-reading acts.
### Linking Clues for Dynamic Guessing  
The program has the capability to **analyze each answer to potentially connect to other clues**. By combining signals, it can **generate new guesses and questions** that help **efficiently arrive at the target** in as few steps as possible. This ability to flexibly link clues is key to its interrogation strategy.
### A Process of Methodical Elimination
It begins by asking **general questions to determine the category** before moving onto more **specific ones to systematically rule things out**. Prior responses impact **future questions down a decision tree** to gradually close in on the solution. Through this elimination process, it's able to solve the mystery.
### Educated Guessing Based on Patterns  
When options are narrowed down substantially, it puts forth choices that have the **highest probability based on the pattern of responses**. From there it aims to **uncover distinguishing characteristics unique to the solution** to get it exactly right.
### Constant Refinement Through Learning
By interacting with numerous individuals, Akinator can **refine its strategy and question bank** over time. This **evolving intelligence** is the reason it remains engaging and challenging to stump even after going multiple rounds with it. Its ability to learn is what enables it to continuously sharpen its mind-reading skills.
