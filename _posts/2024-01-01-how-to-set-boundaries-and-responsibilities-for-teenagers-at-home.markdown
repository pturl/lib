### Daughter refuses to help around the house
Father was **frustrated** that his daughter was **spending all day online** instead of helping with household chores like doing the dishes, laundry, and cleaning. He created a **weekly chore chart** that tied internet access, air conditioning, and movie privileges to completing chores. At first, the daughter only did some of the chores, so she lost some privileges. After a few days without doing any chores, she completed all the tasks to get her privileges back. This approach was **effective at motivating** the daughter, and within two months she had gotten her first job.

### Setting responsibilities to prepare for adulthood  
The parents made a **prioritized list** of expectations like schoolwork, household chores, and family dinners. They tied privileges like living at home and internet access to meeting those responsibilities. The teenager chose some items from the list to take ownership of. This helped the daughter understand that she needed to fulfill her responsibilities in order to enjoy her privileges. While the parents expected some resistance, the daughter learned to be more independent through experiencing the **natural consequences** of her actions.
### Guiding without nagging
Direct confrontation typically led to arguments, so the parents focused on letting the natural consequences do the teaching without nagging. The teenager learned through her own experiences rather than being constantly told what to do. They found that **natural consequences were more effective at changing behavior** than punishment. The parents maintained control by paying bills and setting clear household rules as the adults in charge of the home.  
### Respecting teenage need for independence
It is normal for teenagers to start pulling away from their parents' authority as part of developing independence. However, they still need guidance during this process of becoming adults. The clear expectations showed respect by treating the teenager like an independent person who was responsible for herself. She learned to be successful by **earning privileges instead of being given everything.**
### Building a close relationship for the future  
By consistently enforcing boundaries now, the parents paved the way for a **trusting long-term relationship.** The teenager came to respect that her parents stuck to their goals in an objective manner without taking it personally. The stubborn spirit that challenges rules could be **channeled positively with the right support.** The parents who required responsibility were appreciated even more deeply later on.
### Conclusion
Requiring household responsibilities and linking them to privileges respects a teenager's growing independence. Experience has shown that **natural consequences are the most effective way for teenagers to learn.** Taking a guiding approach rather than a punitive one helps the parent-teen relationship in both the short and long-run.
