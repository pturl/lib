###roblox premium membership tiers###)**
Roblox Premium will replace Builders Club with three straightforward membership tiers that provide greater value. The first tier, dubbed Tier 1, essentially replaces Regular Builders Club. Tier 2 then serves as the direct successor to Turbo Builders Club, while Tier 3 takes over for Outrageous Builders Club at the top level. All tiers offer a set monthly Robux allowance rather than a daily amount. In particular, Tier 2 and Tier 3 actually provide **more Robux per month than their Turbo and Outrageous Builders Club predecessors**. This simplifies the membership structure and increases the Robux benefits.
### **Keeping Popular Builders Club Perks (###roblox premium features###)**  
While streamlining the tiers, Roblox Premium retains many of the advantages fans loved from Builders Club. All tiers continue offering the signature 10% bonus on Robux purchases to stretch entertainment budgets further. Premium members can also trade digital items, sell game creations, and form groups as before. In an exciting upgrade, **Roblox now allows all tiers to monetize their games through Developer Exchange (DevEx) revenue sharing,** not just the top Outrageous level. This empowers more creators to earn from their work.
### **No More Exclusive Digital Accessories (###roblox premium hats###)**
One notable change is that Roblox Premium drops specialized digital hats and clothing pieces exclusive to each membership tier. Previously, Builders Club included commemorative hats like the famed Hood of the International Order of Buildmasters for Regular members or the Outrageous Builders Club Hard Hat at the top. Now, Premium focuses solely on core membership perks rather than cosmetic badges of status. This streamlines the offering while still delivering value.
### **Early Access Testing with Pioneers (###roblox premium testers###)**  
To gradually rollout the new Premium system, Roblox enlisted only 17 vetted users to pioneer the changes. Dubbed "Premium pioneers," these testers provide feedback on bugs and usability ahead of the full launch. Their testing helps refine Premium before the mass migration from Builders Club. The pioneers span a variety of skills from coding to design. Their initial feedback will shape the Premium experience for tens of millions of players worldwide.
### **Gradually Sunset Builders Club (###phasing out builders club###)**
With Premium pioneers proving the updated membership system, Roblox plans a careful phase out of Builders Club over the next one to two years. As testing progresses smoothly, more and more standard features will port over from BC to Premium. Eventually, when Premium is fully proven, Builders Club will retire altogether. This gradual transition minimizes disruption for the longtime BC user base. It also shows Roblox's commitment to quality by thoroughly evaluating Premium first before a complete switchover.
### **Detailed Premium Information Online (###roblox premium wiki###)**
For the latest enumerated details on Roblox Premium tiers, perks, planned timeline, and FAQs, players can reference the dedicated Premium wiki page. There, the monthly pricing, Robux allotments, and current features are clearly documented for each tier. Subscribers can also read developer blogs and release notes for updates. By centralizing Premium information online, Roblox ensures the community stays informed as the new membership system rolls out and evolves over time.
### **A Streamlined Membership Evolution (###summary of roblox premium###)**  
In summary, Roblox Premium modernizes the player experience through a simplified three-tier structure and focus on core advantages over flashy digital accessories. By retaining beloved Builders Club perks, expanding monetization access, and testing thoroughly with pioneers, Premium promises a smooth transition. Gradual phasing out of BC further minimizes disruption. Roblox delivers greater value through increased Robux benefits too. Overall, Premium refines membership to suit Roblox's growing audience of all ages for many more years of fun and creativity on the platform.
