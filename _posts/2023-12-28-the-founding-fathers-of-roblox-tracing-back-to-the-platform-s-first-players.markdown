Roblox has come a long way since its founding in 2006. What started as a small online game creation platform focused on world-building has grown into a global gaming juggernaut with over 50 million daily active users. Behind this massive success was the vision and leadership of Roblox's co-founders and early employees. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into the original player accounts that helped establish Roblox in its earliest days and lay the groundwork for the flourishing creative community it is today.
## The First Official Roblox Administrator 
The **very first** Roblox account was unsurprisingly called "Admin." This account served as the **platform's primary administrator** in Roblox's beta period during late 2005 and early 2006. However, the original "Admin" profile was eventually terminated, likely due to internal policies around administrator privileges on the site. It was replaced by the current "Roblox" account, which still exists today and acts as the official face of the company on its virtual platform. While little is known about the history and activities of the first "Admin" profile, it played a crucial role as Roblox's **inaugural overseer** during the foundational stages of its development.
### Builderman - David Baszucki's Inaugural Avatar
When David Baszucki co-founded Roblox Corporation in 2004 with Erik Cassel, he immersed himself not just as its CEO but also as an avid player and creator on the platform. Using the username "Builderman," Baszucki was among Roblox's very **first builders and developers,** dedicating countless hours in the early days toward crafting maps, games, and virtual worlds. Through Builderman, Baszucki paved the way for user-generated content and demonstrated his vision of an online universe where players could build **collaboratively.** His inaugural virtual persona left an indelible mark and helped establish the creative sandbox Roblox is renowned for today.

### Early Engineering Pioneers: Telamon and Erikbot9000
Two other inaugural Roblox accounts that played instrumental roles in the company's formative years belonged to John Shedletsky and Erik Cassel. As one of Roblox's original engineers, Shedletsky used the username "Telamon" to beta test new features and provide invaluable early feedback on the platform's functionality. Meanwhile, Erik Cassel operated under the name "Erikbot9000," leveraging his account to debug issues, propose service improvements, and contribute behind-the-scenes to Roblox's growing infrastructure in its infancy. Both Telamon and Erikbot9000's behind-the-curtain efforts were **critical** to addressing challenges and maintaining stable operations during Roblox's alpha period.
## The Mysterious Origins of John Doe and Jane Doe
At the end of February 2006, two new test profiles appeared on Roblox - "John Doe" and "Jane Doe." Given their generic names, these accounts immediately assumed an air of mystery that enabled wild speculation among players. Over a decade later, **rumors falsely emerged** claiming John Doe and Jane Doe had been used by Roblox admins or external hackers to infiltrate or conduct illicit activities across the platform. In 2017, Roblox addressed these unfounded allegations on its developer blog, clarifying the accounts were simply internal test profiles with no nefarious associations or hacking activities. 
### Separating Fact from Fiction
To set the record straight, a Roblox wiki entry delved into the **true purpose and history** behind the infamous John Doe and Jane Doe profiles. As the article explains, these accounts were generated automatically by Roblox's internal systems solely for quality assurance and software testing purposes during early development. Despite being mischaracterized online, neither profile had any particular significance beyond serving as generic test avatars. Their enigmatic names and closed profiles understandably led to conjecture, highlighting how unverified claims can spread rapidly across gaming communities.
