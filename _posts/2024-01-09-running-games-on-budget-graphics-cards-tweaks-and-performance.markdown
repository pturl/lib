### Testing the R7 250
The **AMD R7 250** graphics card was paired with an **AMD A10-7700K** CPU. This configuration could run games at 1366x768 resolution with low to medium settings, achieving frame rates of 25-27 FPS in **Metro Exodus**. Titles such as **Warframe, Devil May Cry 5**, and **Forza Horizon 3** were playable at 720p with low to medium quality presets.

### Boosting Performance with the R7 240 
An **AMD FX 4300 CPU** and 12GB of RAM supported the **R7 240** graphics card. Through BIOS optimizations, **Far Cry 4** could run at high to medium settings at 40-45 FPS. **Wolfenstein: The Old Blood** hit near 50 FPS when using high quality presets.
### Surprising Capabilities of the R2
Though viewed as entry-level, the **R2** graphics card was able to run games like **Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V)** at the highest quality presets after extensive tweaking. **Grand Theft Auto IV (GTA IV)** initially struggled with only 4GB of RAM, but performed smoothly with 8GB installed.
### Important Performance Tuning Techniques
Increasing system memory, installing games on solid state drives (SSDs) for faster load times, and keeping graphics drivers up-to-date were some key tweaks for better performance. 
### Pushing the Limits  
While modding can further tax even high-end PCs, lowering settings allowed these budget graphics cards to still reach playable frame rates.
### Conclusion
With optimization through configuration tweaks, even low-cost AMD graphics solutions could run recent titles at reduced graphical presets. Minimal hardware highlights the potential when properly tuned.
