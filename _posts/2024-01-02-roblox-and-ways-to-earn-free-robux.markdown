### Difficult for Regular Employees to Get Free Robux
Regular Roblox employees likely only get Robux as occasional job perks through gift cards or codes. **Only a select few at Roblox have powers to access economy privileges** and any use would be tightly monitored. All DevEx transactions require a separate team to review.

### No Money Options for Parents who Say No to Buying Robux 
The user wants to find ways to earn Robux as parents won't buy any with money. **Popular game creators** on Roblox can make a living off the platform's revenue share. 
### Creating and Developing Popular Games
One way to potentially earn Robux is by creating popular games on Roblox. If a game gains lots of players and in-app purchases, the creator earns a share of the revenue. However, it takes significant skill and effort to develop a hugely successful game.
### Participating in Contests and Giveaways
Roblox occasionally hosts contests where players can win prizes like Robux. Keeping an eye out for any current giveaways and following the rules to enter a chance to win. Though the odds of winning are low, it's a no-cost option to try earning some Robux.
### Completing Online Tasks and Surveys  
Websites exist where users can complete tasks, tutorials, or surveys in exchange for gift cards. Gift cards could then be redeemed for Robux code through the online Roblox store. The payouts tend to be small, so many tasks would need completing to rack up enough value.
### Redeeming Bonus Codes from Game Launch Promotions
Some new Roblox games offer temporary codes for Robux or other items during launch periods. Following game developers on social media can help learn about upcoming code redemption periods. Codes are limited though, so timing would be important to catch during the active redemption windows.
### Trading Limited Items for Robux
Collecting rare limited items through gameplay or past events and then trading up for Robux. Requires knowledge of **current item values** and finding other players interested in trades. Trading can take time but experienced traders manage to earn Robux this way.
### Browse Work-for-Hire Websites for Microjobs
Websites connect people needing small online tasks done with those willing to complete microjobs. Some tasks like basic design work could allow payouts in gift cards exchangeable for Robux. Consistency is needed to build up a balance of gift card credit over many small jobs.
### Seek Sponsorship from Game Developer Groups
Ambitious game creators could pitch game ideas or early access to developer communities. Some groups provide funding, advice or prizes to help new talent - maybe including Robux. A long shot option but could gain attention and support from industry insiders.
