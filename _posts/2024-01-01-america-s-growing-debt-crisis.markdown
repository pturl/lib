### Introduction
America was largely unscathed after WWII and dominated the global economy in 1945. However, its share of global GDP has declined significantly over the past 75 years as other nations rebuilt. **Massive government debt and budget deficits** now threaten America's economic leadership role.

### Skyrocketing Government Debt  
Total US debt recently surpassed $35 trillion and is fast approaching 200% of GDP. Economists warn that debt levels over 60% of GDP can hinder long-term economic growth. Interest payments on the debt now exceed $1 trillion annually and will only rise further. 
### Chronically Low Savings Rate
The US personal savings rate has averaged under 5% for decades, well below most other nations. In contrast, China's high savings rate of 35% has funded much of its investment and **infrastructure development**.
### Endless War Spending 
Since 1980, the US has fought over two dozen armed conflicts costing trillions of dollars. Meanwhile, China has invested heavily in productive sectors while avoiding foreign military entanglements.
### Dependence on Imports and Debt Financing
The US relies on imports, especially from China, to meet domestic consumption needs. It also depends on selling Treasury bonds to foreign creditors like China to finance its budget deficits.
### Declining Competitiveness and Manufacturing Base
One by one, other markets have overtaken US industries and the ability to sell goods globally. **Ongoing outsourcing and lack of infrastructure investment** have eroded America's industrial might.
### Potential Fallout of a Debt Crisis
If China or other creditors reduced US debt holdings, interest rates would spike and sink the economy. Default would destroy the dollar's world reserve status and cripple America's influence for decades. 
### Conclusion
Short-sighted policies have undermined fiscal responsibility and long-term economic stability. Urgent action is needed to rein in spending, revive industry, boost savings and curtail debt issuance.
### Lessons from History  
No nation can maintain global preeminence through free-riding off others' productivity and investment forever. America's troubled fiscal path risks squandering the advantages inherited from past generations.
