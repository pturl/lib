### My Grandfather's Experience with Call of Duty
My grandfather started watching me play **Call of Duty: Black Ops** and seemed thoroughly entertained by the game. Most historical shooter games are not very rattling to veterans compared to real war. However, individual reactions may vary based on personal experiences.

### Saving Private Ryan's Impact on WWII Veterans  
Steven Spielberg's **Saving Private Ryan** featured incredibly realistic sounds and imagery. Some WWII veterans who watched were shaken to their core and triggered PTSD. The film was too realistic for some and they couldn't even watch the whole thing.
### The Challenges of Red Orchestra 2 for New Players   
Unless a veteran player, you will be terrible at **Red Orchestra 2** at first. Skills don't directly transfer from games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. The game aims for historical accuracy with one-shot kills.
### Learning the Hard Way in Red Orchestra 2
In a first game, the writer had zero kills due to the realistic difficulty. He watched his experienced friend get killed by an artillery shell nearby. New players are like "cannon fodder" thrown onto the front lines with little support.
### The Authentic Trauma of War in Red Orchestra 2
Experiencing enemy fire and explosions increases heart rate and impacts aim. Peeking out can easily get a player shot without knowing where the fire came from. Working as a team is necessary for survival against hidden enemies.
### Insurgency as the Most Realistic Modern Shooter
**Insurgency** lacks most HUD elements and players die quickly, like real life. Tactics like quickscoping don't transfer and running impacts later aim. Grenades and counting bullets add authentic realism lacking in other games. 
### The Value of Realism despite Technical Limitations
**Arma** is praised for realistic authenticity but is less accessible due hardware demands. Within technical limits, Insurgency best simulates actual battle experiences. realism provides a valuable perspective even if not a perfect war recreation.
