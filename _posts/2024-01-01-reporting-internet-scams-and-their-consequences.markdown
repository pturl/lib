### **Roblox Actively Hunts Scammers on its Platform**
Roblox takes scams on its platform very seriously. It actively tracks and hunts scammers using cookies and other technologies to identify suspicious activity. Users play a key role by reporting any scams or suspicious behavior they encounter using the "report" button feature. Once reported, Roblox's trust and safety team investigates the situation and aims to **permanently ban scammers from accessing the Roblox site or creating new accounts** if wrongdoing is found. They also work to identify scammer networks and coordinate with law enforcement when severe criminal activity is uncovered.

### **Common Scam Tactics Used on Roblox**
Two common tactics used by scammers on Roblox involve the use of automated bots. Some scammers will deploy **bots programmed to rapidly create numerous accounts** that are then used to promote scam or phishing websites within different Roblox games. The bots will quickly spam chat boards or private messages with links before abandoning the accounts. This allows them to circumvent bans by Roblox since the individual accounts have little lasting value. Other scammers utilize bots to generate accounts that act like players but are actually used for **spamming links and spreading misinformation** about fake contests or deals to steal personal information from unsuspecting users. 
### **Avoiding Account Bans Through VPNs**  
To avoid detection from IP address bans, many scammers operating on Roblox use virtual private networks (VPNs) which **disguise their true location and online identity.** By routing their internet traffic through different countries or servers, it makes it much harder for Roblox to identify someone by their IP and issue targeted bans. As a result, even when plagued accounts get shut down, scammers can simply create new ones since their actual identity stays hidden behind VPN encryption. Stricter identification checks could help curb some repeat offending, but many scammers find workarounds.
### **Reporting Severe Scams to Proper Law Enforcement**
While Roblox does an admirable job handling scams that occur solely within its platform, more severe scams that target users off the website or involve real-world harm should be reported to the appropriate law enforcement. The United States Secret Service in particular has a broad mandate to investigate various types of **financial crimes, identity theft, and other internet-enabled scams.** They will look into serious incidents reported to them and work with local police, the FBI, and international allies as many scams have a cross-border element. Citizens should know which federal and local agencies to contact based on the criminal activities involved for a thorough investigation.
### **Federal Resources for Reporting Cybercrime** 
In addition to contacting local police departments, several US federal agencies maintain online reporting portals and field offices nationwide for the public and businesses to report suspected cybercrimes. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a centralized hub for the public, private sector, and law enforcement to communicate about ***cyber-enabled crimes.*** IC3 receives over 1 million complaints annually and disseminates them to relevant FBI field offices and law enforcement partners globally for investigation. Other key agencies include U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the United States Secret Service, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which all play a role depending on the illegal activities and where they originated.  
### **Special Protections for Intellectual Property Owners**
Given the significant economic impact of intellectual property (IP) theft, the FBI and ICE dedicate specialized units solely to investigating crimes involving copyright piracy, **trade secret theft, and trademark counterfeiting.** They employ advanced forensic methods to dismantle criminal organizations profiting from illegally streamed or downloaded content, and distributing fake branded goods that harm consumers and industries. An IP crime victim guide assists those impacted in learning about legal protections, evidence preservation tips, and how to work with authorities. Reporting IP crimes helps enforce existing statutes while also shedding light on criminality trends shaping new legislation.
### **Coordinating Domestic and International IP Enforcement**  
As the scale and scope of IP crimes increasingly spans nations, the White House created the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (**IPR Center**) in 2000 to address limitations of acting alone. Housing 19 partner agencies under one roof in northern Virginia, the IPR Center pools resources and **intelligence on IP criminal groups.** It produces actionable leads that enable widespread disruption and seizure operations both in the United States and abroad through foreign agency partnerships. Private sector reporting sites like STOPfakes.gov additionally assist this mission by documenting consumer experiences that could signify broader criminal schemes when triaged with law enforcement data.  
### **Evolving Scam Methods Circumvent Controls**
While diligent cooperation across government, industry and public stakeholders has strengthened oversight of cybercrimes over time, online scammers remain highly adaptable and driven by financial incentive. As new defensive measures emerge, bad actors innovate alternative ways of operating just beyond the perimeter of what's currently detectable or banned. The rapid pace of technology itself has also introduced novel means for fraudulent behavior, like **deepfakes and synthetic social accounts that augment human deception abilities.** Staying steps ahead demands continual evolution in both technical capability and awareness throughout society of evolving scam signs and trusted sources of information.
### **Sustained Vigilance Through Awareness and Reporting**
As sophisticated as law enforcement has become in responding to cybercrimes, the sheer scale and borderless nature of internet activities means not every scam or criminal network will immediately fall under suspicion. It remains vitally important for all internet and gaming platform users to remain vigilant when engaging with unfamiliar parties, not blindly click unsolicited links, and knowing where to report anything suspicious encountered. Multiple entities across government, nonprofit, and private sectors help distribute this advice, but individual awareness through communication and education helps strengthen overall resilience against internet harms. With sustained efforts, ongoing risks can be managed even as threat actors mutate their techniques.
### **Collaboration Against an Adaptable Adversary**   
Cybercrime is a remarkable challenge due to the agility crooks demonstrate evolving newer scam models opposed to controlled environments. Addressing this requires proactive partnership between law enforcers, tech providers, security researchers and common people. Though no single entity can entirely curb online frauds, collective actions of identifying threats early, reporting anomalies, rapidly analyzing attack vectors, and sharing intelligence internationally helps curb criminal activities globally. With responsible use of advanced technology and continual societal guidance, the fight against internet deception can remain steps ahead of bad actors. But vigilance and teamwork must continue indefinitely.
