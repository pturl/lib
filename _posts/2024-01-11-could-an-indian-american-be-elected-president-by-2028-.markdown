### Vivek Ramaswamy's Political Rise  
Vivek Ramaswamy is a successful tech entrepreneur and billionaire who has been vocal in his criticism of policies like "wokeism" within big tech companies. With over a decade of experience in the healthcare and biotechnology industries, Ramaswamy co-founded Roivant Sciences and served as its CEO. **In recent years**, he has **positioned himself** more publicly as a thought leader on conservative causes. Ramaswamy penned an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal condemning cancel culture, and co-authored a book titled "Woke, Inc." that analyzes issues with "progressive capitalist" ideas. His perspective has **won fans in Republican circles** and raised speculation that Ramaswamy may pursue elected office in the future given his credentials, high profile, and political connections.

### A Modern Day Ross Perot? 
There are parallels that can be drawn between Vivek Ramaswamy's current trajectory and businessman Ross Perot's unlikely rise to prominence in the early 1990s. Like Perot, Ramaswamy would enter politics as a successful businessman and outsider who is not beholden to either major party establishment. Perot ran for president in 1992 on a platform emphasizing fiscal responsibility and fair trade policies. His **campaign advocating for limiting outsourcing of American jobs and instituting citizen-led ballot initiatives** tapped into voter frustrations with the political status quo. Similarly, Ramaswamy could campaign on implementing versions of policies championed by former President Trump like promoting domestic manufacturing and negotiating **"fair and reciprocal"** international trade deals. 
### Potential Pathways Under a Trump Administration
If former President Trump decides to run again for the presidency in 2024, there is a reasonable chance he may select Vivek Ramaswamy as his running mate. While maintaining some independence as a political newcomer, Ramaswamy has generally supported Trump's stances on issues like **opposing cancel culture, big tech censorship, and partisan "woke" policies**. Serving as Vice President could give Ramaswamy four years of high-level governing experience alongside Trump. This would position him well to potentially seek the presidency himself in 2028, should he and Trump win the 2024 election. 
### Health Concerns and Line of Succession 
However, there are **important health factors** to consider regarding Donald Trump and Joe Biden's advancing ages that could impact the near-term future. Trump would be 83 years old in 2028, and his lifestyle and medical history raise real questions about whether he may be physically able to complete two full terms. Statistics show men of similar age and risk profiles have around a 50% chance of not surviving 8 years in the presidency. As Vice President, Vivek Ramaswamy would be next in the constitutional line of succession should anything unexpectedly happen to Trump before 2028.
### Kamala Harris's Path to the Oval Office
A parallel scenario exists for current Vice President Kamala Harris and her potential path to the White House. With Joe Biden turning 80 this year, there are significant health uncertainties surrounding a second term, or even completing his first 4 year term, given his position as the oldest president in American history. If Biden opted not to seek re-election in 2024 or was unable to, he would likely endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee. This could put her on a straight **trajectory to becoming the first woman president and first Indian-American president** well before 2030 should current trends hold.
### High Probability Combining Factors  
When accounting for all of these variables together - Trump or Biden's advancing age risks, the likelihood of succession, and potential presidential campaigns of Vivek Ramaswamy and Kamala Harris - the probability of an Indian-American being elected to the Oval Office in either 2024 or 2028 rises substantially. Statistical models that analyze these political and health factors **place the chances at around 37.5%**, significantly higher than most casual observers may intuit. While an ethnicity first for the U.S. presidency remains an unlikely near-term prospect, the confluence of circumstances indicates it could realistically happen within the next presidential term or two.
### Changing Demographics Portend Future Shifts
Regardless of the exact timeframe, the candidacies of both Vivek Ramaswamy and Kamala Harris represent how rapidly the face of American politics may change in the coming years and decades. No single ethnicity currently dominates the overall U.S. population, and **by 2045**, it is projected that **white Americans will make up less than half of residents**. As minority groups like Asian-Americans and Indian-Americans continue expanding their share of the electorate, it seems inevitable that representation will also rise at the highest political offices. While many uncertainties remain, an Indian-American in the White House appears a strong probability rather than just a remote possibility looking out to the year 2030 and beyond.
