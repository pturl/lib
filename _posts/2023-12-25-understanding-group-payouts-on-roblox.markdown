### **No Taxes on Direct Robux Transfers Between Users**
Group payouts on Roblox do not charge any additional fees or taxes when directly transferring Robux from a group to another user. The full specified amount will be sent to the recipient without any deductions taken out. This makes group payouts an efficient way for groups to distribute Robux to other users in the community. Whether the recipient is a member of the sending group or not, they will receive the full amount designated in the payout.

### **Eligibility to Receive Payouts From Any Group**  
Any registered Roblox user is eligible to receive a group payout, regardless of whether they are a member of the group initiating the payout. Group owners and administrators have a high level of flexibility when deciding which users they would like to send Robux funds to through the group payout system. Membership status in the sending group does not impact a user's ability to receive Robux sent via a group payout. This open eligibility allows groups to reward both members and non-members within the Roblox platform.
### **Minimum and Maximum Amounts For Payout Transfers**
The minimum Robux amount that can be sent in a group payout is 10 Robux. This low minimum was established by Roblox to maintain efficient processing of the high volume of payouts that large groups facilitate on a regular basis. While there is a minimum amount to initiate a transfer, there is technically no maximum limit set on the potential Robux amount that can be sent in a single group payout. Groups have the capability to distribute very large sums of Robux depending on the available funds in their group account balance. This flexibility provides opportunities for groups to make significant payouts when rewarding top community contributors or hosting large prize tournaments and giveaways.
### **Standard Processing Timeline For Payout Completion**  
In most cases, the standard timeline for a group payout to be fully processed and deliver the Robux to the recipient's account is less than 24 hours. After a group administrator or owner initiates the payout, the Robux transfer is deposited promptly into the specified user's account. However, groups are advised to allow for potential fluctuations in the processing period and always communicate to payout recipients that funds may take up to a day to be credited. The Roblox platform aims to complete the vast majority of payouts within hours, but larger transaction volumes could potentially cause longer completion windows. 
### **Directing Payouts To Group Or Personal Balances**
When initiating a group payout, the sending group has the option to designate whether the Robux should be deposited directly into the recipient's group funds balance or personal account balance. This flexibility provides choice on how the received Robux can potentially be used. Depositing to a user's group allows the funds to potentially be used for group purchases and prizes, while sending to their personal balance frees up the Robux for any purpose across the Roblox platform. Depending on the purpose of the payout, groups can select the most appropriate destination for the transferred Robux.
### **Contacting Roblox Support For Additional Assistance**
For any other questions about the mechanics of the group payout system or the policies governing payout transactions, Roblox customer support is available to provide guidance and assistance as needed. Both group owners and individual users are encouraged to contact support if they require clarification or have issues with pending or completed payouts. The Roblox support team works hard to resolve payout concerns promptly to ensure a seamless experience for both sending and receiving parties involved in the transfers. Players and groups alike can get the help they need around the clock.
### **How Roblox Receives A Cut Of Virtual Item Purchases**  
While direct Robux transfers between users via group payouts are not subject to any transaction fees or taxes, Roblox does retain a small percentage of the revenue generated when groups make bulk purchases of virtual items and other products for redistribution. Specifically, Roblox retains a 30% cut of the transaction value for any group purchase orders to cover the underlying operating costs associated with maintaining the platform and supporting huge volumes of commerce. So although groups may pay the full listed price of items during bulk orders, only around 70% of the purchase total can potentially be redistributed to other users or groups through group payouts or gifts. It's important for groups to be aware of this revenue share model to have realistic expectations of how much inventory they can recoup and redistribute.
### **Accounting For Roblox's Cut When Gift Giving Large Amounts** 
As an example, if a group wanted to gift 1,000 Robux to another user or group via a group payout, they would actually need to generate around 1,300 Robux worth of revenue first through sales, events or by other means. This is because after Roblox takes their 30% cut of any purchase transaction, only around 70% of the original amount—in this case 1,300 Robux x 0.70 = 900 Robux—would remain accessible in the group's balance. In order to truly gift the intended 1,000 Robux to another party after accounting for Roblox's cut, an initial 1,300 Robux would need to be collected. Proper financial planning is crucial for groups hoping to distribute large reward amounts to ensure recipients receive what was promised.
### **Clarifying Past Confusion Over Evolving Policies**  
While the core mechanics and policies surrounding direct group payout transfers have always allowed funds to change hands tax-free between users, some past systems governing bulk purchases and revenue shares have evolved in more complex ways over time. This has led to occasional confusion from both groups and players about the exact procedures and amounts involved. This blog aims to address any lingering questions or misconceptions by plainly laying out the current single-step group payout process. At the same time, it acknowledges broader shifts in how Roblox has historically balanced revenue models while accommodating a massively growing platform and commerce ecosystem. Full transparency helps further legitimate understanding of the payout mechanics that actually impact users today.
