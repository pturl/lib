### Introduction
With the high costs of new games and console hardware, it can be tempting to resort to piracy to save money. However, piracy comes with serious risks like bricking expensive PlayStation 4 consoles. There are safer, legal alternatives that allow gamers to play great games without breaking the bank or terms of use agreements. This article will explore cost-effective options for building a game library through sales, used games, hardware modifications and more.

### Part I: The Risks of Piracy 
Piracy may seem like an easy way to get games for cheaper, but the potential downsides are simply not worth it. **Sony reserves the right to "brick", or permanently disable, any PS4 console that violates its End User License Agreement (EULA) through the installation of pirated software.** While a cracked version of the latest $60 AAA title might install for free, getting caught could render a $400 gaming system into an expensive paperweight. PlayStation's strong anti-piracy protections also risk online access being banned if illegal copies are detected. With so much money invested in the hardware itself, it's not a good gamble just to save $30 on a single game that could be found on sale down the line through legal means. 
### Part II: The Value of Used Games
A safer, affordable alternative is buying used games instead. Popular titles can often be found pre-owned at retailers like GameStop, Amazon Marketplace or local game stores for a fraction of the original price. For example, a game that retailed for $60 on launch may only cost $20-30 pre-owned just a few months later once the initial rush dies down. Used games don't carry the risks of piracy since they were purchased through legitimate means originally. Online multiplayer is also typically still accessible. With patience and some hunting, it's possible to build a sizable back catalog of quality games through the used market and spread the overall costs out more reasonably over time.
### Part III: The Power of Digital Game Sales  
For digital-only gaming, major online storefronts like PlayStation Store, Steam and Xbox Live often run deep discounts throughout the year. Holiday sales in particular provide opportunities to pick up freshly released AAA **blockbuster titles for up to 50% off or more** just a couple months after launch. With a little planning, gamers can load their virtual shelves with popular games at prices comparable to or even lower than pirated versions. The cost savings add up substantially over time building a collection through sales rather than succumbing to the temptation of piracy. Deals on older games or franchise collections are common as well, allowing budget gamers to catch up on classics and bestsellers for bargain bin prices. 
### Part IV: The Value of Game of the Year Editions
For gamers willing to wait 6-12 months after release, "Game of the Year" or "Complete/Ultimate" editions provide incredible long-term value. These packages bundle all the downloadable content (DLC), bonus modes, quests and features into one affordable package. Prices usually settle in the $30-40 range on both disc and digital formats, which represents the full experience of that title for significantly less than purchasing everything piecemeal. GotY editions effectively deliver most of what piracy aims to - the complete game - but through legal and low risk means. Patience is rewarded with the full benefits of all updates and add-ons without missing online access or risking account bans down the line. 
### Part V: Hardware Modding carries Heavy Risks  
A small fraction of gamers attempt to modify their consoles like the PS4 to circumvent online features and playback pirated software. While some claim this allows piracy with little danger, the reality is hardware hacking exposes systems to high detection risks down the road. As console makers like Sony release new firmware, modded PS4s face potential **permanent bans from PlayStation Network or even bricking entirely.** Given the hundreds of dollars invested in the latest PS4 Pro or Xbox One X hardware, the potential downside greatly outweighs any short term gain from a few illegally obtained games. Network access provides additional value like online multiplayer, streaming media apps, and firmware/game updates essential for continued use. It's just not worth jeopardizing such an expensive machine for the few dollars savings of piracy.  
### Part VI: Building a Backlog with Digital Game Sales
With sales promising discounts year-round on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Live and Steam, budget-conscious gamers can fill their virtual shelves with quality titles to entertain themselves for extended periods of time. Rather than pirating to play the latest hot release, spreading game purchases out over multiple sales events helps keep costs down substantially in the long run. Maintaining a queue of games picked up at discounts provides a backlog to dive into for months on end. The games are legitimately owned and tied to accounts, avoiding any risks associated with pirated copies. With patience and a little research into upcoming promotions, any gamer can develop an impressive library and stay clear of the legal/technical pitfalls that piracy entails. 
### Part VII: Conclusion
In conclusion, there are safer, cheaper alternatives for building a sustainable game library without resorting to piracy. Used game markets, digital sales, GotY editions, and building a backlog over time all empower gamers to play great titles without breaking the bank or terms of use. With a little planning and patience, anyone can enjoy their favorite hobby legally and cost-effectively through these low-risk strategies. The high costs of new releases and hardware don't need to tempt gamers into piracy's serious downsides like bans, account termination or bricking expensive consoles. With some creativity, gaming joy can be experienced affordably through legitimate means.
