### **Salaries, Cost of Living, and Job Prospects**
Engineers in the Philippines earn on average only $722 per month before taxes, barely enough to survive given the high costs of living in major cities like Manila. Engineers are required to complete at least 1.5 years of advanced calculus and other higher education classes, yet their salaries don't reflect the difficulty of such an education. Teachers earn even less on average, around only $422 per month, despite educating the next generation. With 10 other qualified candidates waiting for nearly every open job position, workers have little bargaining power to demand higher pay from their employers. The high population density in urban areas also means long commuting times and high stress levels in daily life.

### **Supporting Families Through Difficult Circumstances**  
Educated professionals struggling to support their immediate and extended families on meager salaries sometimes feel tempted to engage in dishonest schemes to earn more, such as scamming foreigners online. Money sent home from salaries abroad can be the sole source of financial support for multiple families. Those without higher education have even fewer options, often taking physically demanding jobs for just $150-200 per month. Merely surviving and helping loved ones becomes a daily challenge in such situations of extreme **low-income poverty**. 
### **Online Romance Scams and Rationalizations**
Lacking better opportunities, some Filipinos unfortunately turn to manipulating foreigners through online romance scams. They pretend to fall in love or share sob stories asking for money with no intent to repay it. While wrong, such acts are sometimes rationalized as the foreigners deserving to lose money they dupe. However, innocent people are also hurt by these scams.
### **Education, Entrepreneurship, and New Technologies** 
Despite challenges, many Filipinos find ways to improve their lives through education and entrepreneurship. Online platforms create new opportunities for skilled **knowledge workers** in fields like programming, customer support, and digital marketing. However, all must pursue such avenues ethically and sustainably to build true long-term economic progress. 
### **A Brighter Future Through Shared Efforts**
With continued hard work and supportive policies, lives and the nation can rise to their greatest potential. Greater access to education and new technologies can help address issues of poverty and income inequality. The Filipino spirit of community and optimism for the future gives hope that combined efforts across all sectors of society can realize quality of life improvements for all citizens.
