### Finding your "why" to stay motivated initially and whenever feeling demotivated  
To stay motivated throughout my preparation, I found my "why" which was securing a government job using my GATE rank. Whenever I felt demotivated, I would revisit my **goal of getting a 70 AIR** which kept me going.

### Writing down your goals and feeling to revisit for motivation
Setting **SMART goals** and reviewing them daily was a key strategy. I wrote down small weekly goals as well as my end AIR goal. Referring back to these goals on tough days reignited my motivation to work hard.
### Tracking time with apps like TimeTune and Todait to stay on schedule
Installing time tracking apps like **TimeTune and Todait** helped me be accountable. I scheduled my day in the app and tracked how long I studied each topic. This enabled me to stay focused and maximize my preparation time.
### Solving previous years' questions but verifying solutions
I practiced by solving many **PYQ papers of the last 10 years** to get exam practice. However, I double checked my answers with solutions to learn from any mistakes and not learn wrong concepts.  
### Making your own notes for effective revision  
Taking detailed notes while studying helped consolidate my learning. I created **digital flashcards using Anthropic** for easy revision on the go. This improved my recall ability during mock tests.
### Using visualization to better understand concepts
For tougher topics, I drew pictures and diagrams to visualize abstract concepts. This **visual learning technique** made theoretical concepts more clear and memorable.
### Giving many mock tests in exam-like environment for practice  
I attempted at least one full length mock per week in an **exam hall-like setting** with strict timing. This helped improve my speed and exposure to varied question patterns.
### Recording mistakes to avoid repeating them
After every mock, I thoroughly analyzed my mistakes and noted down common errors. Reviewing this **mistake diary** helped eliminate careless errors in subsequent tests.
### Revising regularly from the start in rounds to keep concepts fresh  
I revisted important topics and chapters every 10 days to retain what I had learned. This **spaced repetition approach** ensured my preparation remained fresh in the long run. 
### Using mnemonics to remember formulas and names
For remembering difficult formulae and definitions, I created silly **mnemonic devices and acronyms**. This visual memory technique helped me recall information on demand during the exam.
### Setting daily goals and routines for focused preparation
I scheduled my day with strict timings for self-study, practice, revision and breaks. Keeping a **disciplined routine** helped me utilize my time optimally for quality preparation. 
### Practicing with virtual calculator before exam
To avoid calculator-related mistakes in the actual exam, I rehearsed calculations using the **virtual GATE calculator** app in advance. This built speed and familiarity with the on-screen calculator.
### Giving many tests seriously and analyzing solutions
I took 17 full mock tests from different providers seriously during my preparation. A thorough analysis of every mock using **marking schemes** revealed gaps to be addressed.
### Tracking performance over tests to identify weaknesses  
Analysing my test series scoresheet highlighted topics I needed more practice in. I paid **focused attention** on weaker areas by solving extra questions and taking tutor help.
### Ensuring proper sleep, food and calm before exam
On the D-day, I avoided last minute cramming and got 7-8 hours of sound sleep. A light snack 2 hours before the exam along with some relaxing music helped keep my mind calm.
### Thinking only positively during exam for some extra marks  
During the actual exam, having confidence in my preparation helped tackle difficult questions positively instead of panicking. Maintaining a **composed attitude** earned me some bonus marks. 
### Giving your best during the important exam hours
I maintained steady pace during peak scoring hours of 9am-11am to maximise my marks. Taking short breaks helped me return with renewed focus to my **time-bound goal of 70 AIR.**  
### Using apps like TimeTune and Todait to track time and stay on track
Time management apps like **TimeTune and Todait** played a big role by keeping me on schedule for self-study as well as tests and revisions.
### Referring to GateOverflow and GeeksforGeeks for CS topics
Websites like **GateOverflow and GeeksforGeeks** provided quality content for CS topics in a well-explained manner. I regularly viewed video lectures and solved questions on these sites.
### Benefitting from test series, video lectures and courses
Enrolling for test series from reputed coaching institutes along with their **classroom programs and live video lectures** gave me comprehensive preparation guidance.
### Maintaining a mistake record book for avoiding repetitions  
Recording every mistake from tests in a **dedicated notebook** helped identify weak areas and errors to avoid. It proved very useful during last minute revisions.
### Areas I could have focused more - ESE PYQ, all tests  
Looking back, practicing more **ESE PYQ and giving full attention to every test** could have boosted my preparation even higher.
### Not using physical calculator was another learning  
During my initial mocks, reliance on a physical calculator caused some silly mistakes. It was a valuable lesson to get **used to the on-screen calculator.**
### Not wasting time on motivational content, self-doubting   
Towards exams, keeping doubts at bay and solely focusing on **productive studying** without distractions proved very helpful. 
### Continuously working hard with faith in one's ability
With persistent effort and trust in my capabilities, I was able to achieve my goal despite initial hiccups. Maintaining a **positive work ethic** saw me through.
