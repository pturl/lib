### Initial Discovery and Early Orders (2016-2019)
I first discovered **Robu.in** in 2016 while searching online for affordable **3D printer** options in India. Being an engineering student at the time, **Robu.in** immediately caught my attention as one of the largest online stores for electronics, sensors, and robotics components in the country. Over the next three years, from 2016 to 2019, I placed over 25 separate orders on their website for items ranging from **microcontrollers, sensors, motors,** and **batteries** to complete **DIY kits** and small **drone parts**. 
During this initial period, I was impressed by Robu.in's wide selection of products and the speed at which orders were processed and shipped. All of my orders arrived within 2-3 business days of payment through India Post's tracked shipping services. The items were well packaged in bubble wrap or foam sheets to prevent damage during transit. Not once did I receive a faulty or defective product. Their prices were also competitive compared to buying electronics pieces from multiple local shops.

### Problem with a Faulty Water Flow Sensor Order
In late 2019, I decided to build a simple **water level monitoring system**using an **Arduino microcontroller** and needed a basic **water flow sensor** to measure flow rates. Robu.in had one listed at a reasonable price so I ordered it without a second thought. However, when the sensor arrived, I noticed its inner diameter was too narrow to work with my 3/4 inch plastic tubing. No matter how much I tried to force the tubing in, there was no sensor output. 
I raised a return query with Robu.in customer support by email, providing pictures of the faulty product. Within a day, they replied with instructions to ship the item back to their warehouse at my own expense for a refund. I dutifully sent the package and received confirmation of its arrival a week later. Sure enough, my full refund minus the return shipping cost was processed to my PayPal account within the next 3 business days. While having to pay for return shipping myself introduced some inconvenience, I was satisfied with how swiftly Robu.in resolved the issue.
### Packaging Quality Can Be Improved
For the most part, **I found Robu.in's packaging** of items to be well-padded and protective. However, there was one order in 2018 that caused some frustration. When setting up a **motion sensor project**, I noticed a small brass spacer nut was missing from one of the ordered **DIP sensor modules**. Attempts to contact customer support by email went unanswered for over a week. 
When I finally got a reply, the agent claimed there was no record of the missing part in their system and could only offer me a 15% store credit as compensation. This left me in a difficult position since the specialty nut was not easily available in local markets. It took me almost a month of searching niche hardware stores before lucking upon an identical replacement. The experience showed me that Robu.in needs to better inspect and verify orders before shipping to proactively resolve issues.
A friend of mine who also orders regularly from Robu.in faced a similar problem recently. During transit, the outer box containing his latest **microcontroller** kit was smashed open. Thankfully, the inner layer of foam held the components safely. But he had to go through the hassle of contacting support and waiting for a replacement shipment, which arrived without issue the second time. This highlights the need for **Robu.in to reinforce packaging** and prevent damage during transportation by rough handling.
### Amazon and Flipkart Offer Better Return Policies
When compared to bigger online retailers like **Amazon India** and **Flipkart**, Robu.in lacks in one key area - flexible return policies. Both Amazon and Flipkart allow customers to return most unopened items within 7-30 days for a full refund including return shipping. This provides hassle-free protection against faulty products or wrong purchases. 
At Robu.in, the onus lies completely on the buyer alone for returns. While their refund process is quick once an item reaches the warehouse, customers end up shouldering the burden and risk of return shipments without reimbursement. Especially for niche components and small businesses on tight budgets, this friction can be a deterrent. Unless an item is blatantly defective based on pictures provided, compensation only happens through store credits too.
In such scenarios, it is often more convenient to first check Amazon and Flipkart for electronic components availability. Their premium customer service makes returns and resolution of issues extremely streamlined. Only when a specific part isn't found elsewhere should one consider ordering from Robu.in after carefully managing return risks.
### Swift Resolution of a Faulty BMS Board Issue 
In late 2020, I built an electric bike using a **48V** lithium-ion **battery pack** purchased from Robu.in. To balance and protect the cells, a **BMS battery management board** was also acquired. Upon initial testing, I noticed one of the BMS circuits was not functioning correctly and not charging one of the cells in the pack. 
Wondering if a component had gone bad, I shot a message to Robu.in on Facebook Messenger explaining my problem. To my pleasant surprise, their executive responded within a few hours and asked me to ship the board back for diagnosis. Within 24 hours of sending it, they messaged saying a replacement was on its way already along with an apology for any inconvenience caused. True to their word, the new board arrived within 3 business days, resolving the problem swiftly without fuss.
### Checking Orders and Resolving Issues Proactively    
Based on my cumulative experience with Robu.in over nearly half a decade now, there are a couple areas where they could enhance customer satisfaction further:
1. Dedicate staff to thoroughly inspect each order before packing and shipping. This would catch issues like missing parts proactively. 
2. Standardize returns process to include reimbursement of return shipping costs for any defective items within 15 days. Buyers should not bear unnecessary risks or costs.
3. Improve packaging used to withstand vibrations and impacts of regular India Post surface transportation. Reinforced boxes, foam sheets, and sealed tamper-proof tapes can prevent damage.
4. Make customer support responses timelier. Issues left unanswered breed frustration and negatively impact brand perception over time. 
5. Educate staff on empathetically solving problems without repeatedly asking for pictures or other proofs from customers. 
With these small process improvements, Robu.in can take it to the next level and further build trust among regular buyers while expanding their reach in India's booming DIY market. Timely issue resolution is key to retaining loyal, long-term customers.
### In Summary
Summing up my experience with Robu.in over several years of use, I believe they are one of the recommended choices for purchasing diverse electronics, sensors, and robotics components from India. Their wide selection has been very useful for all my hobby and academic projects. Most order deliveries arrive smoothly and the website navigation is simple. Robu.in's prices are reasonable for the value offered in specifications and quantities available. 
However, some inconsistent quality in packaging has led to occasional damage during transit while verification of orders could detect missing parts proactively. Their customer returns policy lacks the flexibility offered by peers resulting in added costs. While issues raised are usually resolved eventually, response turnaround and empathy during problem-solving needs improvement. With dedicated efforts to strengthen these limited aspects, Robu.in could cement an image as a premier one-stop-shop for India's growing DIY ecosystem. Overall, the benefits continue to outweigh minor shortcomings based on my usage over the years.
