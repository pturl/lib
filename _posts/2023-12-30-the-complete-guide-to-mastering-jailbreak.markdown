## Starting your Criminal Career (###Breaking out of Prison)
Prison in Jailbreak is no picnic. As a new prisoner, you'll spawn in a dingy cell with only your fists to rely on. Here are some tips for making a swift escape:
**Punch open the wooden boxes** around your cell to find small items that can help like crowbars or lockpicks. Keep striking until one breaks open. 
**Look for areas where the wall is crumbling** - these weak spots are your ticket to freedom. Wail on them repeatedly until a hole starts forming. Small enough for you to squeeze through. 
**Head to the sewers** - located in the prison yard, this is one of the quickest escape routes. Slide down the pipes and emerge outside the walls to start your criminal career.
Keep an eye out for **cop players hanging around the prison** - if you can overpower one, you can steal their keycard to unlock doors and make a clean getaway. 
## Joining the Criminal Underworld (###Reaching the Criminal Base) 
Once free, it's time to join forces with your fellow lawbreakers. Make your way to the **criminal base hidden in the hills** - you'll find an arsenal of weapons and rides waiting. 
Stock up on the essentials like **Uzis, shotguns or assault rifles** to take down cops. You'll also want some wheels - try hotwiring the **Sportscar or Offroader** for speed and maneuverability.
With gear in hand, you're ready to start pulling **heists at the Bank, Jewelry Store or Museum** for big payouts. Case each location to learn their unique **obstacle courses and security measures**.
## Cracking the Bank Vault (###Navigating the Bank's Security)
Of all the robberies, hitting the Bank can net you the most cash - but it also presents the biggest challenge. Here's how to pull off the perfect bank job:
Make your way inside during opening hours and find the **keycard-locked vault room down below**. Swipe a card to activate the timers and begin the heist.
You'll then face a series of **hazardous puzzles** like spike walls, lasers or spinning blades standing between you and the loot. Study the pattern of each **obstacle course** to find the safest path. 
While collecting the piles of **cold hard cash**, keep an eye on the minimap for any pursuing cops - a well-timed eject can send them flying if they get too close!
With timers counting down, sprint back to the entrance and eject all nearby cops for a clean getaway in your waiting vehicle. Nice work, you just became a premier bank robber!
## Variety is the Spice of Life (###Other Profitable Robberies)  
Though the Bank tops the charts in payout potential, don't forget about the other robberies to keep things exciting. Each has their own risk vs reward dynamic:
- The **Jewelry Store** poses less of an physical challenge than the Bank, but pays less. Snap up gems and diamonds as fast as you can before cops arrive.
- Robbing the **Museum** lets you directly attack any security systems and cameras for a bonus. However, its elaborate booby traps mean this is not for the faint of heart. 
- For a change of pace, also consider robbing the smaller locations like the **Gas Station** or **Convenience Store**. Though minimal effort, every dollar helps - and it's low risk if things go south!
Keeping things varied prevents criminals from growing complacent. Mix up your targets regularly to truly master the art of the heist.
## Growing your Police Ranks (###Rising through the Force)  
While outlaws cause chaos, it's up to officers of the law to restore peace. New recruits start with basic gear - a **pistol, taser, lockpit cuffs and spike strips** for vehicle takedowns. Here's how to progress:
Earn cash by making **arrests either on foot or from your patrol vehicle**. The more prolific, the quicker you can upgrade. Spend cash at the **police station shop** on better weapons. 
As you gain experience, higher ranks unlock access to advanced equipment like the all-powerful **Forcefield** for crowd control or armored vehicles like the glorious **Swat Van**.  
Master the art of **vehicle takedowns** - well-timed pit maneuvers or hits with spike strips can instantly disable crooks on the run. For those too speedy, carry a **heli or jet** for aerial pursuit.
Keep a close eye on the **bounty board** listing the server's most wanted. Chasing these high-reward targets is the surest way to swiftly rise up the police ladder.
## Intelligence is Key (###Using your Detective Skills)  
To catch crooks effectively, officers must think like one. Evaluate each situation strategically:
Monitor the **mini-map** for notification of robberies in progress. Be ready with a patrol car or heli nearby for rapid response. 
Study past robber patterns to better **predict future targets**. Criminals often follow routines - so ambush their favorite spots preemptively.
If a perp evades capture, don't lose hope. Check the **bounty board** for clues to their wanted level or vehicle. Pursue anyone fitting that description relentlessly. 
Use of **undercover vehicles** allows stealthy stakeouts of known criminal havens. Wait patiently and the rats will come to you in time.
Factor in how different crews operate too - some specialize in **high-speed getaways** while others prefer **armed standoffs**. Adapt techniques accordingly.
## Locking down the Scene (###Defending Robbery Locations)  
When the alarm sounds, race over ASAP to secure the area. With cunning and quick thinking, you can often finish the job single-handed:  
At the Bank, simply wait **hidden inside the vault entrance**. Criminals have no choice but to walk right into your trap mid-robbery!
For other sites, **park an armored vehicle out front** for mobile cover. Peak out firing to flush any robbers in a panic. 
Deploy a **forcefield at a chokepoint** to corral any escaping crooks in one area for easy tasing. Remember, stun guns recharge faster than crooks run!
Get creative - use the environment like parked cars for **temporary barricades** or the terrain for **hillside ambushes**. Outsmart rather than just outgun the outlaws.
## Upgrading your Arsenal (###Investing in the Best Weaponry)
To truly dominate the streets of Jailbreak, leave no option off the table when it comes to firepower. Keep progressing your arsenal:
Unlock the almighty **Missile Launcher** for taking down helicopters, jets and any vehicle. Nothing says authority like blowing up fugitives from afar! 
For those tough close-quarter fights, invest in shotguns like the **Double-Barrel** or **Riot Shotgun** to instantly shred groups with wide spreads. 
When numbers are against you, go big with the **Minigun** - its devastating rate of fire chews through criminals in seconds flat. Mow 'em all down!
Beyond weapons, use protective gear too. The **Riot Shield** lets you power through crowds unscathed while dishing damage. An absolute unit!
Master every tool at your disposal and soon no criminal will doubt who truly enforces the law around here.
## Life in the Open World (###Advanced Strategy and Skill Mastery)
Once you've escaped prison and had your fun with robberies, Jailbreak offers endlesssandbox gameplay. Here are some advanced tactics to try:
**PvP in Cops vs Criminals mode** - engage in all-out warfare across the maps in this Teams mode. Coordinate strategies with your faction for victory.

For those seeking relaxation, hang at the in-game **player city** to socialize, trade vehicles or just admire others' fancy rides.
