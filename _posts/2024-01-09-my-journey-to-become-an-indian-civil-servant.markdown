### Early Dreams of Public Service
As a young child growing up in rural India, I was inspired by stories of civil servants who worked to improve people's lives. From a young age, I **dreamed of following in their footsteps to enact positive change**. However, pursuing this dream seemed like a distant goal with many challenges ahead.

### Pursuing Higher Education with the Goal of Public Service in Mind 
During my college years from 2015 to 2017, I decided to pursue a degree in political science to gain the necessary foundation to someday join the civil service. However, exam preparations took a backseat as I focused on my studies. Looking back, I realize I should have begun preparing earlier to have a better chance at success.
### Setback Led to Renewed Focus and Dedication 
After graduating in 2018, I struggled to find suitable employment and began to doubt my ability to fulfill my childhood dream. Feeling lost, I made the difficult decision to resign from my job and fully commit to preparing for the exams over the next year. It was a challenging time, but staying true to my goal of **civil service and public administration** kept my determination strong. 
### Living Alone to Fully Immerse in Preparations  
In early 2019, I moved out on my own to a small apartment in the city in order to live a monastic lifestyle fully dedicated to preparations. Living alone allowed me to focus intensely on self-study for 16 hours a day without distractions. This solitary year of preparations helped lay the groundwork for eventual success.
### Narrowly Missing the Mark in My Second Attempt
I took the preliminary exam for the second time in 2017, feeling more prepared than my initial attempt. However, to my disappointment, I fell just short of the cutoff score. This **near miss hit me hard**, but I was determined to learn from my mistakes and try again.
### Third Time's the Charm? Clearing Prelims but Falling Short in Mains
My perseverance paid off when I cleared the preliminary exam in my third attempt in 2018. Unfortunately, I failed to clear the more difficult mains exam. While upsetting, passing prelims proved I was headed in the right direction with my preparations. I resolved to push onward towards my goal.  
### Reflecting on Lessons Learned Along the Way
Over many attempts and years of trying, I have gained invaluable experience and wisdom. Failure has taught me resilience and patience, while small successes kept my spirits up. Most importantly, reflecting on my journey has shown me that **determination and grit are key to overcoming obstacles** on the path to achieving long-term goals.
### Advice for Future Aspirants from a Fellow Learner
For others hoping to join the civil service, my advice would be to begin preparations in a timely manner, maintain a daily routine and never lose sight of your "why." Difficult times will come, but staying positive and drawing strength from your motivation can help you push through challenges to eventual triumph.  
### Maintaining Perspective and Positivity with Wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita 
Through it all, I drew inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita's message â€” "you have a right to work, but never to the fruits of it." By focusing on the work itself without attachment to short-term outcomes, I was able to weather setbacks and keep my larger purpose in mind. This perspective helped maintain my positivity and motivation over several years of trying. I believe this wisdom will continue guiding me on the path ahead.
