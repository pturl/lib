## Part 1: Modifying the Default Face File 
### ###Customizing the Base Face Mesh
Roblox allows users a limited degree of customization by default. One option is directly modifying the base face mesh file locally on your computer. However, **this method has risks** and only changes the face appearance for the user, not others. To customize the default face:
Open the RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe file and locate the "characters" folder. Inside will be a file named "face.txt" which contains the vertices that define the face mesh shape. Replacing this file with an edited mesh allows changing things like eye position, mouth shape, or adding facial features. Keep in mind **this only modifies the local game files** and customizations will not translate to other devices or be visible to other players online. 
### ###Potential Issues to Consider  
While modifying game files provides the most direct control over customization, it is not officially supported and could potentially lead to account issues. Files may become corrupted or incompatible with future Roblox updates. There is also always a risk custom game changes could be flagged by Roblox anti-exploit systems. For these reasons, it is typically not advisable to modify core game files unless done very carefully.
## Part 2: Creating an In-Game Decal Face
### ###Uploading a Custom Decal Image
A safer method of customization uses Roblox's built-in decal system. First, designers can create an image for their custom face using photo editing tools. Common formats like PNG work best. Then, they need to **upload the image as a new Decal** using the Create menu in the Roblox catalog. 
### ###Applying the Decal with Scripting
Once the image is a decal, a script is required to insert it onto the player's character model ingame. The basics are to grab the player's character model part, attach a new "Decal" part as a child, then set the Decal.Texture property to the ID of the uploaded image decal. This allows **applying custom face graphics on a per-user basis**.
### ###Limitations of the Decal Method  
A benefit is decals sidestep modifying game files directly. However, decals only function within a single game and the custom face **will not carry over to other places on Roblox**. The decal also has less customizability than directly editing the base mesh. Still, for displaying customized graphics, decals provide a safer alternative to modifying core files.
## Part 3: Using Exploits is Not Recommended
### ###About Exploits and Risks to Consider
Some players attempt using exploits to achieve more direct customization. Exploits take advantage of technical flaws in Roblox's coding to manipulate the game in unintended ways. While this provides maximum customizable control, **using exploits poses serious risks that are not worth it.** Exploits can potentially compromise account security, corrupt saves, lead to abusive behavior, or even result in a permaban from Roblox. 
### ###Staying Within Official Guidelines is Best  
Rather than utilize exploits, Roblox users are encouraged to respect the platform and partners by only using official and intended customization methods. Over time, Roblox continues expanding options while also maintaining safety and quality standards. For now, the best approaches are modifying defaults locally, creating decals, or purchasing additional customization through membership.
## Part 4: Designing Customizable Wearable Items
### ###Creating Customizable T-Shirt Designs
A more robust customization option utilizes Roblox's item system by creating new wearable t-shirts and pants. Designers can leverage their image editing, 3D modeling, or coding skills to craft unique wearables with custom graphics, shapes, or animations. Once created, these items can then be shared with others on Roblox through the catalog.
### ###Benefits of the Item System Approach  
While wearable items may not allow a perfect 1:1 face replacement, they provide a robust way to project identity. Custom t-shirts act as personalized "skins" that travel with users between games. With programming, animated features or interactivity can also be added. Overall, the item system allows a high degree of on-avatar personalization and custom graphics that scale across Roblox.
### ###Considerations for Wearable Designs
Of course, wearable items require extra effort to model, script and publish. Items must also adhere to Roblox content policies regarding appropriateness and technical functionality. But for those willing to put in design work, the item platform affords some of the most impressive and sharable customization possibilities on Roblox today.
## Part 5: Additional Perks of Builders Club Membership
### ###Custom Character Creator App
Beyond decals and wearables, Roblox Builders Club members gain access to the "Character Creator" app. This robust, full avatar customizer allows freely applying outfits, accessories, hat and face gear items, and adjusting body sliders. While still limited compared to mesh editing, the Creator provides an expansive hub for assembling ultra-customized characters.
### ###Tons of Free Items and Discounts 
Membership further unlocks exclusive gear like special faces and exclusive gear, along with generous discounts on items from the catalog. The additional free items help builders club members stand out with stylish, hard-to-get looks that others cannot access without spending more Robux.
### ###Worth It for Serious Avatar Designers
Over time, the Character Creator keeps expanding. BC membership pays for itself through discounts and remains a must-have for anyone serious about **crafting exceptionally customized online presences** with maximum outfit options and style in Roblox games.
## Part 6: Hoping for Future Expansions 
### ###Potential Reasons for Current Limits
While modders crave total customization freedom, there are sensible arguments for Roblox restricting some options. Direct mesh editing could allow exploit behavior or inappropriate content. Meanwhile, a simpler default face promotes approachability for new players.
### ###Room for More Options Going Forward
That said, Roblox continues evolving. As they refine moderation tools and interface options, there may come a day where even greater customization could become possible. Perhaps alternate face meshes could exist as approved uploaded items. Filters and moderation systems might allow more direct control over core avatar components. Only time will tell!
### ###Thank You For Your Creativity and Compliance
In conclusion, Roblox balances creative expression with safety rules that protect the variety of ages who play. Though limits exist today, continue showcasing talent through decals, clothing items and other approved methods. With your understanding and cooperation, Roblox can consider expanding acceptable options over time. Most importantly, keep having fun customizing your avatar within permitted guidelines!
