### Clean Out Unnecessary Processes  
The CPU in your laptop may not be powerful enough to keep up with the demands of modern games, especially if running at high settings. This causes the more powerful GPU to sit idle as it waits for the CPU. Programs running in the background can slow down performance. Uninstall any programs you don't use regularly from the Add/Remove Programs section in Settings. Reinstalling Windows can wipe out unnecessary apps.

### Upgrading Laptop Components is Not Possible
The CPU and GPU in a laptop are soldered directly to the motherboard and cannot be swapped out like in a desktop. You're stuck with the hardware you bought the laptop with originally. A desktop PC allows upgrading individual components like the **CPU**, **GPU**, **RAM** and storage. This provides much more flexibility and power over what's possible in a laptop over time. 
### Check for Overheating Issues
Laptops are prone to overheating, especially certain models like the **Acer Nitro 5**. High CPU and GPU temperatures will cause slowdowns. Clean out dust buildup and replace the thermal paste to improve cooling. Many owners have found replacing the pre-installed thermal paste results in a 20 degree Celsius drop in temperatures. This is likely due to low quality paste used from the factory. New paste can significantly improve cooling.  
### Consider a Gaming Desktop
It's normal for individual threads/cores to max out occasionally during intensive tasks. But all cores maxing out at the same time suggests an underlying problem. Start with eliminating background processes and checking temperatures. Only consider this if other troubleshooting doesn't resolve high CPU usage. Back up any important data first.
### Summarize Solutions
To fix high CPU usage issues, prioritize cleaning system and applications of bloatware, monitor temperatures and consider replacing thermal paste, or building a more powerful gaming desktop for ultimate performance control. All CPU cores reaching 100% is unusual and reinstalling Windows as a last resort can remove software issues accumulated over time.
