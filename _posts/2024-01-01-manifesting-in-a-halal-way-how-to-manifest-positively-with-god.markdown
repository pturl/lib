## Introduction
Manifesting has become a popular trend in recent years, especially among young people seeking personal growth and fulfillment. However, traditional methods of manifesting directly invoke concepts that seem to contradict core Islamic beliefs. As Muslims, we need to understand manifesting from an Islamic perspective and determine how, if at all, it can be practiced in a halal manner aligned with our faith. 
### Defining Manifesting
Manifesting refers to the process of clearly visualizing one's goals or desires and affirming their existence through positive thoughts and statements in order to make them reality. The underlying principle is that our thoughts and words have power to shape external outcomes. However, Islam teaches that **only Allah (God) alone determines and controls all that exists or will exist.** We must direct our intentions and requests solely to Him.

## The Correct Target of Manifesting
### Asking from Allah Alone 
In Islam, the only acceptable target of manifesting, visualization, affirmations or any form of asking is **Allah, the Supreme Creator and Controller of the Universe.** We should have absolute faith that only He grants desires and controls the unfolding of events. While positive thought routines may be helpful, their ultimate purpose in an Islamic context is to increase remembrance of and gratitude to Allah alone.
### Granting Desires is Exclusively Allah's Domain
It goes against tawheed (Islamic monotheism) to direct intentions or assign power to anything other than Allah, whether general concepts like "the Universe" or specific created things like the stars, moon or natural phenomena. All control and fulfillment of needs comes from Him through His will and wisdom. We must respect these boundaries to avoid falling into shirk (polytheism) even if unintentionally. 
### Increasing Remembrance of Allah
Making requests directly to Him through prayers, supplications, charity and righteous deeds is most likely to earn His mercy and blessings. Regular remembrance through salah, reading Quran and engaging in other acts of worship strengthens a believer's connection to Allah and dependence on His favor alone.
## It is Halal When Done for Allah
### Intention is Key 
Manifesting itself is not haram or forbidden in Islam if properly directed at the ONLY true possessor of power - Allah. As long as the intention behind visualization, affirmations or other manifestation techniques is to gain something positive from Allah, and not for prohibited ends, then it would not be considered objectionable or a form of black magic. 
### Avoiding Haram Practices
However, techniques rooted in or promoting shirk such as astrology, numerology or spells would still be haram regardless of intent. Muslims must ensure any manifestation methods used strictly observe Islamic rules and stay within biblical boundaries to remain permissible. The means as well as aim must be for Allah's sake alone.
### Producing Good Deeds 
If done properly, positive thinking and affirming one's commitment to righteous goals like education, career success or strengthening family bonds could serve to strengthen one's faith and motivate good deeds pleasing to Allah. Our words and intentions, like all else, ultimately belong to Him alone.
## Avoiding Shows Promoting Magic 
### Influence of Popular Culture 
The modern world exposes Muslims to a plethora of un-Islamic ideas through various media. Shows popular globally that normalize or even glorify magic, the occult, astrology and pagan spiritual concepts risk negatively influencing viewers over time, especially youth.
### Distracting from Obligations 
Watching such content excessively amounts to a waste of precious hours that could be used for religious study, self-improvement or productive work instead. It may form addictive habits and desensitize viewers, distracting from prayer and other obligations. Constant immersion in fantastical worlds also risks blurring the line between reality and fiction. 
### Alternative Hobbies and Pastimes  
**Quran memorization, Islamic educational videos, spending time with family, developing practical skills, engaging in hobbies like sports, art or coding - these provide wholesome alternativte for Muslims seeking entertainment or escapism without compromising on faith.**
## Benefits of Stopping Excessive Viewing 
### Positive Spiritual Impact
Many former "TV addicts" report benefits like stronger faith, more time for worship, increase in gratitude and contentment after limiting or stopping excess viewing of unproductive content. They rediscovered spirituality and purpose in life by filling vacant hours with meaningful alternatives.
### Improved Mental Wellbeing
Excess screen time correlates to higher stress, anxiety, depression and poor sleep - issues impacting youth significantly. Reducing digital overstimulation through disciplined moderation supports mental and physical health according to experts. 
### Regaining Control  Over Habits
With willpower and Allah's help, disciplining urges allows one to avoid distraction and negative triggers selectively for self-improvement. Over time this instills confidence and ability to direct instincts towardselevating goals aligned with our purpose as believers. 
## Conclusion
In conclusion, manifesting one's desires can be made halal in Islam if the sole target of intentions, requests and visualizations is Allah alone. However, we must avoid any practices involving magic, astrology or assigning powers to created beings as these constitute shirk. Filling leisure time with beneficial alternatives to shows featuring unislamic concepts protects faith and wellbeing while bringing us closer to our Creator. With Allah's infinite blessings and mercy, positive manifestation guided by tawheed is possible.
